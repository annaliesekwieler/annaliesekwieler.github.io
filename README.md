Hi, I'm Annaliese! I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Perkins Lab at the University of Notre Dame with an expected graduation in May 2023. I am interested in statistics and modeling applied to infectious diseases, clinical trials, and data-driven research.

### Skills and Interests

I am a PhD candidate in Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame, and I am also doing a master's degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics. I have a dual major bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Biology from Tabor College, a small liberal arts college in Kansas. 

I began statistical programming while doing an REU at the University of Georgia in 2016, and I haven't looked back. I am approaching an expert level in R, and I am quickly gaining skills in Python and SQL.

I have many hobbies, including language learning (English is my native language, and I have studied French, Spanish, German, Russian, Italian and Norwegian). I also love experiencing cultures through travel, cooking, and international film.
